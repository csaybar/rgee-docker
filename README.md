# rgee-docker

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/85984414.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/85984414)

Geospatial Docker for rgee, building on rocker/geospatial.

This image is a modification of [`rocker/geospatial`](https://github.com/rocker-org/geospatial) with support to Python 3.7 and Selenium drivers.  As such, this image includes RStudio and tidyverse packages. Versions older than the most recent will install R packages from an MRAN snapshot, and may not provide all the same packages as seen on the most recent versions. 

## Installation and execution
- Install [docker]()
- In terminal execute

```
uploading the docker images in my toaster with an internet connection from Peru :'v ... please wait
